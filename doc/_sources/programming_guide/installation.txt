Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

most of functionality
______________________

    + six https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six/
    + pyglet https://github.com/pyglet/pyglet

particles support
_________________

    + numpy www.numpy.org

audio and video support by pyglet and ffmpeg
____________________________________________

    + for Windows and Mac the simplest is 'python -m pip install pyglet-ffmpeg2'
    + for Linux you should use your package manager to get ffmpeg, version 4.x is
	the one tested with pyglet.
    
audio support by SDL
____________________

    + in Windows, pygame http://www.pygame.org
    + in unix-like OSes libraries sdl 1.2 and sdl-mixer 1.2; in debian/ubuntu their packages are libsdl1.2 and libsdl-mixer1.2
    + in Mac, theres no confirmed info. Should be similar to unix.


What explicit dependencies are declared in the setup.py ?
six and pyglet


Compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compatibility notes at the time of writing, September 2019

    + python : cocos needs python 2.7 or 3.4+
	
    + The cocos codebase has direct support for 2.x and 3.x, so no need to run 2to3

    + pyglet : pyglet 1.4.3, don't use lower versions, 

Installing
^^^^^^^^^^

Have a modern setuptools or pip installed.

While::

    python -m pip install cocos2d

works, you will miss the docs and code samples. Its is therefore recommended to

    + install six and pyglet, pay attention to the pyglet version, see above 
    + download cocos2d-0.6.7.zip from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cocos2d/
    + decompress to a convenient location, the top dir will be cocos2d-0.6.7
    + the html docs will be in cocos2d-0.6.7/doc/html
    + useful code samples will be in cocos2d-0.6.7/test, cocos2d-0.6.7/samples, cocos2d-0.6.7/utest
    + install by::

        cd cocos2d-0.6.7
        python -m pip install -e .

      or alternatively by pointing that directory from a .pth or PYTHONPATH
    + All of cocos should be usable now, with the possible exceptions

        - cocos particles
        - SDL audio backend
        - ffmpeg audio-video backend 

If you want to add these, look at the dependencies section.

Using PYTHONPATH or .pth
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is safe to point a checkout of cocos from a .pth or PYTHONPATH both
in python 2.x and 3.x; the same checkout can be pointed at the same time from both pythons.

The same is valid for pyglet.
